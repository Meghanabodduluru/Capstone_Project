## üìñ Project Overview:
<P>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and personalized treatment planning are critical for improving patient outcomes.
This project analyzes breast cancer patient data to predict survival, treatment response, and infection risk using gene expression and clinical datasets (GSE datasets). The focus is on deriving actionable insights from complex biomedical data to support clinical decision-making.</p>
<p>In this project, we used gene expression and clinical datasets (GSE25066 & GSE19783 from NCBI GEO) to predict:
 
- Survival outcomes
  
- Treatment response
  
- Infection risk
We implemented Machine Learning (Random Forest) and Deep Learning (Neural Networks) models, applied SHAP explainability to identify genetic key features most associated with patient outcomes and deployed an interactive Gradio interface for real-time predictions. </P>

## üîπ Approach
## 1.Data Source 
The analysis depends on two distinct datasets.
* **GSE25066**: Which has gene expression profiles for breast cancer patients and is employed to predict survival outcomes and treatment responses.
* **GSE19783**:* Which provides gene expression data prominent to infection risk.
* Datasets were downloaded from the NCBI GEO repository in compressed format and converted to CSV for analysis.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
**Steps performed:**  

* **Data Retrieval:**  
  Downloaded and extracted datasets using GEOparse, then converted them to structured CSV files.  
  ![Data Retrieval](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5f95cdc-b1db-4b33-936a-7ec09da47f84)  

* **Data Cleaning:**  
  Selected only relevant gene expression columns (GSM) and added a `Probe_Category` column.  
  Proxy labels for **Survival_Outcome, Treatment_Outcome, and Infection_Outcome** were created using KMeans clustering.  

* **Normalization & Splitting:**  
  Standardized the gene expression data using `StandardScaler` (mean=0, std=1). Split datasets 80% for training and 20% for testing.  
  ![Normalization](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d542438-a666-4f1f-9571-7fdd48bd3e80)  

* **Challenges:**  
  - Proxy outcomes may not fully match clinical labels, introducing noise.  
  - Infection dataset had fewer features (115 vs 508), limiting model predictions.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**i. Mean Survival and Infection Outcome**  
Non-survivors had higher mean gene expression (~9.5) vs survivors (~6.0). High infection risk patients also showed higher expression (~11 vs 7).
